# `create-clarity-feature`

This CLI helps you get started on developing a custom feature for [Clarity](https://www.jcore.io/clarity).
Use the following command:

```sh
npx create-clarity-feature@latest
# or
yarn create clarity-feature
# or
pnpm create clarity-feature
# or
bunx create-clarity-feature
```

`create-clarity-feature` will ask you for the name of your project, whether you want to use TypeScript,
and various other options.

Once the project is created, it will install `react`, `@jcoreio/clarity-feature-api`,
[`@jcoreio/clarity-feature-toolkit`](https://github.com/jcoreio/clarity-feature-toolkit/tree/master/packages/clarity-feature-toolkit),
and other dependencies you need to get started.
